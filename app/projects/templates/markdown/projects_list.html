<h2 id="patent-methods-and-systems-for-multi-label-classification-of-text-data---2020">1.1. Patent: Methods and systems for multi-label classification of text data - 2020</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11163947B2/en">US11163947B2</a></strong></p>
<p>Led the team that developed a novel multi-label classification method that utilizes soft labelling and stacking of multiple models to improve text classification performance</p>
<h2 id="enhancing-pio-element-detection-in-medical-text-using-contextualized-embedding---2019">1.2. Enhancing PIO Element Detection in Medical Text Using Contextualized Embedding - 2019</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://aclanthology.org/W19-5023.pdf">Published</a> in <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/18th-sigbiomed-workshop-biomedical-natural-language-processing">BioNLP 2019 : 18th ACL Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing</a> in Florence, Italy</strong></p>
<p>A new approach to Population, Intervention and Outcome (PIO) element detection for Evidence Based Medicine and a new dataset created by applying multiple rule based labelling functions to unlabelled data and reweighing and combining their outputs into a single, confidence-weighted training label per data point. Obtained an ROC-AUC score of 0.9998</p>
<h2 id="a-review-of-standard-text-classification-practices-for-multi-label-toxicity-identification-of-online-content---2018">1.3. A review of standard text classification practices for multi-label toxicity identification of online content - 2018</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ea9QuE1g5oBfBg7ik-UM9wIjnSvzaAkL/view">Published</a> in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/alw2018/program/accepted-papers">ALW2</a> workshop at <a href="https://aclweb.org/portal/content/2nd-workshop-abusive-language-online">2018 conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2018)</a> in Brussels, Belgium</strong></p>
<p>As the available data for toxicity classification is heavily unbalanced (in most web-crawl datasets the amount of toxic sentences are usually far fewer than neutral/positive sentences), developed novel methods to augment the data and use multiple ML models together to improve accuracy and achieved an ROC-AUC score of 0.9862</p>
<h2 id="detection-of-abusive-online-behaviour-using-multi-label-classification---2018">1.4. Detection of Abusive Online Behaviour Using Multi-Label Classification - 2018</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://montrealaisymposium.wordpress.com/accepted-papers-montreal-ai-symposium-2018/">Montreal AI Symposium</a> in Montreal, Canada</strong></p>
<p>Poster presentation about a comparison of conventional SVM vs a GRU DNN model for text classification with different text representation methods.</p>
<h2 id="principal-component-analysis-based-occupancy-detection-with-ultra-wideband-radar-2017">1.5. Principal component analysis-based occupancy detection with ultra wideband radar 2017</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8053237">Published</a> in the <a href="https://ieee-cas.org/conference/2017-ieee-60th-international-midwest-symposium-circuits-and-systems-mwscas">60th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)</a> in Medford, MA, US</strong></p>
<p>Developed a novel method for occupancy detection using Ultra Wide-band (UWB) radar. The developed algorithm is able to distinguish two people separated by only 0.8m with 86% accuracy while also being able to detect binary occupancy 100% of the time</p>

<h2 id="autonomous-inventory-robot">2.5. Autonomous inventory robot</h2>
<p>Developed a robot capable of of autonomously navigating inside a retail store environment while avoiding obstacles and taking inventory of RFID tagged merchandise for a fortune 500 retailer. This robot also won the following awards: - Winner in the Research and Development category and the winner of the overall gold award in the National Best Quality ICT Awards Sri Lanka, 2015 organized by the British Computer Society (BCS). - Winner of the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards 2015 (APICTA 2015 Awards) in the Research and Development category. The Asia Pacific ICT Alliance is an alliance between 16 member countries in the Asia Pacific region and the autonomous inventory robot won the gold award competing with 11 teams from Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia.</p>
<h2 id="telepresence-robot">2.6. Telepresence robot</h2>
<h2 id="fpga-based-image-enhancement-and-object-detection-system.">2.7. FPGA based image enhancement and object detection system.</h2>
<p>A system capable of receiving new images from a computer and processing them with various filters on an Altera Cyclone II FPGA and displaying them on an onboard LCD display was developed. An Altera NIOS II soft processor was used in conjunction with the hardware modules to handle image transmission, storage and display.</p>
<h2 id="fpga-based-hdmi-transmitter-and-receiver-module.">2.8. FPGA based HDMI transmitter and receiver module.</h2>
<p>An HDMI transmitter module on a Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA and a receiver module on a Xilinx SPARTAN 6 FPGA was developed.</p>
